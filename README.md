This Online Movie Ticket Booking Platform API was created by using spring 3.2.3.
Notes about the application:

* It is integrated with an AWS MySQL database instance. More conf details are located at the application.properties file.
* I followed the Domain Driven Design methodology to name the classes and packages.
* The Online Movie Ticket Booking Platform API is made of CRUDL methods (Created, Read, Update and Delete).
* The app once this gets run, it automatically creates some example records on the DB. The information was given properly on the ReservationGenerator.java class file.
* In case of questions, please let me know and we can coordinate a Zoom quick call.
